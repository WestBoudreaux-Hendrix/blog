Skateboarding is one of my favorite activities. It feels like a truly unbridled form of expression. Whether it's just cruising with my friends or trying new tricks at the park, I feel the most free with a board under my feet. When it comes to ranking my favorite styles of skating, I do have a rough idea in order. 
<ol>
<li>Miniramp</li>
<li>Stairsets</li>
<li>Flatground/Freestyle</li>
<li>Park/Transition</li>
<li>Hillbombing</li>
</ol>
