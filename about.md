This is a blog following my journey through CSCI 340 during the spring semeseter 2026 at Hendrix College. I am a senior computer science major. You can find my LinkdIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/west-boudreaux-710a3731b/">here</a>. I enjoy hanging out with my friends a lot as well as spending time by myself. I am involved in multiple extra-curricular activities in college: I am the captain of the ultimate frisbee team and I am a backup dancer in one of my close friends Miss Hendrix dance. In my free time I enjoy skateboarding, reading, playing video games, playing music, being outside, driving my old truck around, or just sitting in contemplation.
