Setting up this blog has been a serious struggle. First it was figuring out the right verion of ruby, how to install it, and where exactly to run it. Once I got that all sorted out, I struggled with figuring out the order in which I needed to update my server so that I could see changes I was making to the code locally. Eventually, it started working more as I expected where I could reload the page and it would display changes that I made. Following the steps outlined in the <a href="https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyll.html">assignment</a> was really helpful when I did not know what to do. I still struggle to have a complete grasp on the entire workflow of vscode to github. I have had a couple of commit issues during this process which made it so that I could not update my forked version of the blog. Here are some things I am excited to learn this semester:
<ul>
<li>Make fun and interactive websites</li>
<li>Learn more about frameworks</li>
<li>Further strengthen and expand my coding abilities</li>
<li>Do my best to stay on top of my work load</li>
</ul>
Maybe one day I will even make a website that is cool enough to be included in this awesome <a href="https://bored.com/">website</a>.
