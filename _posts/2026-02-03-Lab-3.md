lab 3 has had us navigate the Jekyll format system. In theory it makes a lot of sense as a collection of files that, together, construct the website and allow for a more modular feel. That said, in practice, navigating the structure to correctly reference pieces proved to be difficult for me at times. Most specifically while I was trying to edit the sytlesheet. First, I was curious and confused as to why it was a .scss file and not the previosly-used .css file type. That aside, I went on trying to make edits; my initial changes were to broad tags, namely h1 and li. When I tried to then make stylistic changes to more specific aspects of the website, I found that I could not correctly identify each piece specifically. I wanted to make the items in my header a certain color, perhaps add a background color to it, and, seperatley, add a background color to the page contents. I would say I made some progress at least finding my way around and conceptualizing how everything is connected; however, I am eager to learn how to find the correct tags to add style to so that I may further customize my page. I want to take inspiration from super cool and interesting websites like <a href="https://curious.co/">this one.</a> Though, I do not plan to have nearly as many moving parts or complexities; I just enjoy the fact that it is wacky and weird and super interactive.

This is the most effort I have really put in to any classes regular assignments. I made it my goal to really push myself to work hard for my last semester. In doing so, I am also romantisizing my work to look a little something like this guy.
