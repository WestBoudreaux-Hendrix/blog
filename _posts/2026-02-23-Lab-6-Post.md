Lab 6 had us create an entity relationship diagram and an SQL schema for a local grocery store. The client wanted customers
to be able to sign up with their name, address, and phone number. Once registered, customers should be able to start an order; in each order customers specify which items they want and how many of each, provide any necessary special instructions, whether or not they want substitution of items. After an order is finalized, the customer will provide whether they would like to pick their order up, or have it delivered to their accounts address; further, they will also list the date and time for the pickup or delivery. Lastly, the client wished for finalized orders to no longer be changed by the customers. 

Some assumptions that I made while modeling this scenario include: 
<ul>
    <li>Deliveries would be made to the address linked to a customer's account</li>
    <li>Quantity of items can never be null - 0 as a quantity seemed more fitting for being out of stock</li>
    <li>Customers could make multiple orders</li>
    <li>Orders would include multiple items</li>
    <li>Customers could not fill out delivery information until after selecting 'y' to a finalize question</li>
    <li>Payment would be processed upon pickup or delivery via institutions already in place</li>
    <li>Item descriptions served in place of item images to help customers know what an item is more specifically</li>
</ul>

Five User Stories I used to help myself model
<ol>
    <li>Customers can sign up with name, phone number, and address. Size: 10, Connection: ability to place order</li>
    <li>Customers can add special instructions to an order. Size: 2, Connection: customer satisfaction</li>
    <li>Store can add descriptions to items that they distribute. Size: 3, Connection: help fascilitate online shopping</li>
    <li>Customers can choose between pickup or delivery at a specific datetime. Size: 8, Connection: ability to recieve order</li>
    <li>Customers can decide if they want an item to be substituted were it out of stock. Size: 4, Connection: customer satisfaction</li>
</ol>
